    <h2>Mini Project: Accident Reporting using AI</h2>

<p>Presently, accident reports require statements to be provided at the police station.
Increased witness numbers and limited police manpower escalate the workload and stress for the police force during accident reporting.
Witnesses may also be unable to provide testimony to the police due to personal reasons.
This leads to inefficiencies in collecting accident data.
To aid in addressing this issue, our project simplifies accident reporting by offering an online platform for submitting accident reports.

 <h2>Major Project:SmartMeter: IoT-Based Energy Monitoring with ML</h2>
 <img src="./images/ckt final.jpg" height="200" alt="ckt picture"/>
 <p> Traditional electricity monitoring systems are inefficient, often inaccurate, and 
    lack real-time data, leading to unnecessary expenses and missed savings. Our project uses IoT, arduino, artificial intelligence, and cloud technologies to deliver real-time usage tracking, automatic bill estimates, energy usage tips and smart alerts. With peak usage stats, fault detection and personalized recommendations for energy-efficient devices, our system empowers users to cut costs and optimize their energy consumption.</p></br><hr/>
